## Project Summary
#### 	The goal of this project is understand modern capabilities of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and how we can use AR to solve problems for, or enhance, industries. For this project, we are working with a client who is currently using Vuforia (AR SDK) and Unity, but would like assistance in coming up with creating solutions to unique problems. The most important part of working with Vuforia's SDK is understanding what its capabilities are and how we can use them. Vuforia offers several types of image targets and image objects, which can be utilized in different ways depending on the case. These types of targets include: Image Targets, Multi Targets, and Cylinder Targets. Object targets provided by Vuforia include: Object Recognition (Object Reco), VuMarks, Model Targets. Image and object targets can be differentiated by thinking of image targets as image recognition purely utilizing images and thinking of object targets as utilizing whole objects for image recognition. Furthermore, Vuforia ground plane can be used to make environments in Unity, which can then be projected environment onto a flat, plane surface in real life. We hope to use this document to set a path for introducing people to developing AR applications. 
#### We strongly recommend utilizing Unity and Vuforia for beginners. Both are extremely powerful tools for creating a variety of AR applications. In 2017, Unity and Vuforia made it much easier to create basic Augmented Reality applications by integrating Vuforia into the Unity development environment.

<h4 class="markdown style="bottom-margin:50px;"> If you are downloading and installing <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, make sure to select the option to install the Vuforia import; this will make using AR features in Unity easier.</h4>

## Getting Started
#### There are a few important things to to note starting out. You will need to create an account for Vuforia in order to link a Vuforia project with a Unity project. This key is also used as a reference to manage your image targets for your application so make sure to make a Vuforia account. Also make sure to download [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) if you haven't already. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgd21lbhikU) was super helpful in getting started and understanding how to set up an AR Camera in Unity and building/deploying an application.
