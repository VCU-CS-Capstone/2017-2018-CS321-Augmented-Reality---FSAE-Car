 #Project Summary
## The goal of this project is understand modern capabilities of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and how we can use AR to solve problems for, or enhance, industries. For this project, we are working with a client who is currently using Vuforia (AR SDK), but would like assistance in coming up with creating solutions to unique problems. The most important part of working with Vuforia's SDK is understanding what its capabilities are and how we can use them.
  
##  Vuforia offers several types of image targets and image objects, which can be utilized in different ways depending on the case. These types of targets include: Image Targets, Multi Targets, and Cylinder Targets. Object targets provided by Vuforia include: Object Recognition (Object Reco), VuMarks, Model Targets. Image and object targets can be differentiated by thinking of image targets as image recognition purely utilizing images and thinking of object targets as utilzing whole objects for image recognition. Furthermore, Vuforia ground plane can be used to make environments in Unity, which can then be projected environment onto a flat, plane surface in real life.
