## Project Summary
#### 	The goal of this project is understand modern capabilities of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and how we can use AR to solve problems for, or enhance, industries. For this project, we are working with a client who is currently using Vuforia (AR SDK) and Unity, but would like assistance in coming up with creating solutions to unique problems. The most important part of working with Vuforia's SDK is understanding what its capabilities are and how we can use them. Vuforia offers several types of image targets and image objects, which can be utilized in different ways depending on the case. These types of targets include: Image Targets, Multi Targets, and Cylinder Targets. Object targets provided by Vuforia include: Object Recognition (Object Reco), VuMarks, Model Targets. Image and object targets can be differentiated by thinking of image targets as image recognition purely utilizing images and thinking of object targets as utilizing whole objects for image recognition. Furthermore, Vuforia Ground Plane can be used to make environments in Unity, which can then be projected onto a flat, plane surface in real life. 

#### We hope to use this document to set a path for introducing people to developing AR applications. Our goal is to get you up to speed on modern AR so that you can begin designing soultions more quickly. Before you download Vuforia and Unity, make sure to consider your options. We cover this in the next section "Before You Start".

#### Unity and Vuforia are extremely powerful tools for creating a variety of AR applications. In 2017, Unity and Vuforia made it much easier to create basic Augmented Reality applications by integrating Vuforia into the Unity development environment.

## Before You Start
#### Before jumping straight into Vuforia and Unity, we should talk about Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore. While we focused on Vuforia because it was what our sponsor used initially, eventually our sponsor started looking into ARKit. That being said, you should consider whether you have to use a certain SDK (is your sponsor/client constraining you) or can you explore other options. If you're not being constrained, we believe that ARKit or ARCore may be your best options. Vuforia is really easy and convenient for setting up simple AR applications, but it was hard to go beyond that. Based on what we've seen and researched, we believe that Google's and Apple's SDKs would have been better than using Vuforia. 
#### Keep in mind the hardware and software constraints of each: With Vuforia, the device you need depends on the type of targeting you're using. For example, newer forms of targeting such as Ground Plane use newer devices. Check out Vuforia Ground Plane Requirements [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/ground-plane-supported-devices.html). Vuforia's requirements can be cumbersome to work with and with Vuforia you will have to use Unity. 

#### If you pick ARCore, you have a few [options](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/) for development environments, mainly Android Studio, Unity, and Unreal Engine. If you have devices to work with it, ARCore seems like the most flexible option. ARCore's device requirements can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/). Also, as a side note, check out this [link](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/developer-guides/anchors) to understand more about anchors. It explains the concept well, and it applies to every SDK regardless of which one you pick.

#### If you are considering ARKit, keep in mind the constraint of working with Apple products. You're going to need Apple devices to deploy the app on to in order to test and demo, as well as a Mac to actually develop and build your apps with XCode. We deployed our apps onto iPad Air 2's, but we were only able because one of our group members had a Mac for his personal laptop. While we were able to build and deploy, having only one Mac lead to a bad workflow for our group. To test our apps on the devices, we had to have our Mac guy pull from our git repo and test it for us. If there were problems, it was hard to fix over messaging and voice communications, so we usually had to meet in person to debug deploying issues. Device requirements for ARKit can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix.html).

#### These are all important things to consider when picking an AR SDK to work with so make sure to take some time to think about it and discuss it with your group. 

## Starting Out
#### There are a few important things to to note starting out. You will need to create an account for Vuforia in order to link a Vuforia project with a Unity project. This key is also used as a reference to manage your image targets for your application so make sure to make a Vuforia account. Also make sure to download [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) if you haven't already. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgd21lbhikU) was super helpful in getting started and understanding how to set up an AR Camera in Unity and building/deploying an application. There are tons of videos on youtube that can help you comprehend different ways of using the unique types of targeting. Vuforia also has a 'getting started' section that you can look at [here](https://library.vuforia.com/). From there, you can find all the documentation for Vuforia.

## Targeting Options
### Vuforia classifies three features inside its library: Images, Objects, and Environments. We won't go into detail on all the individual types of targeting, but we talk about what to be aware of when using them. Vuforia includes user guides for all of them within their documentation as well.
#### Images: 
#### Includes Image Targets, Multi Targets, and Cylinder Targets. Image Targets all use image recognition to recognize an imamge in order to trigger an action or event to occur. That being said, its important to use images that can be recognized more easily to have greater performance from your application. Vuforia gives images a rating when you upload them to your project database; Vuforia has great documentation on this that can be found [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/Optimizing-Target-Detection-and-Tracking-Stability.html). Some of the basics are that you should print a picture that has these qualities: rich in detail, good contrast, lack of repetition or patters (favor randomness). You should avoid printing anything in a glossy finish as that will add a lot of glare, and try to keep images as flat as possible (no wrinkles in the paper). You will want as many features on the picture as possible; features generally come from sharp edges in the picture. Keeping this in mind, round objects in images will have no features so a picture of bubbles would have a low quality. Keep all this in mind when uploading your own images.

#### Objects: 
#### Vuforia objects includes Object Recognition, VuMarks, and Model Targeting. Object Recognition requires you to scan small objects that can be recognized, but it is very limiting for scalability (can only scan small objects). VuMarks are kind of like QR Codes, but can only be generated dynamically through the VuMark Generation API, which is only available with a Vuforia Pro account. Model targeting came out in January 2018, but can only be accessed by the upper tiers of Vuforia's licensing offerings; we were able to test it by using the 10 free tries they allow for a developer account. Model targeting is useful because it allows you to overlay a 3D object. It is less limiting than Object Recognition, but we are not sure how large the object can be. You need a physical object and the CAD file for that object to make it work which can be constraining, but it works well once you get it running.

#### Environments: 
#### Includes Extended Tracking and Ground Plane. [Extended tracking](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Extended-Tracking) solves the issue with large content being placed into the world. If the content being placed is larger than the current view of the camera, Vuforia uses Extended Tracking to allow the user to move away from the view of the image to see the rest of the content. Ground Plane is Vuforia's version of markerless targeting, known as AR Stickers in Google's ARCore and Apple's ARKit. Ground Plane detects flat surfaces where content can be placed by tapping on the phone or tablet screen display. 

## User Guide
#### There are 3 directories in this repositories, which are each a separate Unity project. To use the projects, first pull the repository to your computer and then open Unity. After opening Unity and logging in, click on 'Open' in the top-right header. Navigate to the project directory you want to open, click on it, then click 'Select Folder'. This should open the project within the Unity developer environment. Two of the projects won't be usable because you need the physical object or image to use the apps. One of these projects used image targets that were on our capstone poster just to demonstrate image targets in a cool way. The other one is a model targeting application which overlayed a lockbox. If you open it and run it, you should see an overlay for the object. What you can test is the "GPTesting" directory if you want, but it's just a basic version of placing an Object into the world using a Vuforia's Ground Plane. You just open the app and tap on the screen to place the content (should be a couch in this case). We were able to write scripts to be able to transpose, scale, and rotate the placed object, but it became troublesome when placing multiple objects. We were able to place multiple objects into the environment, but could not anchor them exactly where we wanted them. 

## Advice
#### The best advice we can give is to listen to your sponsor and try to focus on one of their problems that you can solve. Our project lacked depth and focus more than anything. Looking back, we think we could have made a more complex, full-stack and cloud-based application as a backend had we gave our project more thought. Also, if you're working with business students for your capstone project, make sure to work with them to create a great business model, and take some time to understand the numbers behind the model they build. We hope this documentation can get you up to speed quickly, so you can focus more on ideas and problem solving.
